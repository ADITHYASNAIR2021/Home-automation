# Home-automation

This project implements a Home Automation System.
By automating tasks that are done by humans, we can save time and energy. The
hectic daily life routine sometimes makes men forgetful such as forgetting to
switch off the devices at home. This clumsy attitude and is packed with the daily
life routine sometimes puts us in a hurry, resulting in us being careless about the
devices at home. Also, itâ€™ll have a significant impact on the electricity. In This
regard, an automation system becomes relevant in these times
